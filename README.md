Report page for MVC course there we focuse on object-oriented programming techniques in the PHP programming language.

Using framework Symfony I built few pages including the 21-game, library that communicates with database using Doctrine ORM and my final project for this course.

The project is about one of the Sustainable Development Goals - Good health and well-being.
I show a few charts with some statistics that I store in database using ORM. There is also an about-page with projects documentation.
